Try another disc in the player to verify that the player is not the source of the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the <i>disc</i> still doesn’t <i>play</i> properly, you can report this thorugh our IVR at 1-866-733-2693 (Option 1) by entering the barcode and your payment information.

Purchase a movie at the Box<br/>\n3.  Make an On Demand transaction<br/>\n<br/>\nThese qualifying transactions are only complete once you make a successful payment (if applicable).  Each disc is counted separately toward your status levels even thought they may be part of the same transaction. For example, you rent 2 discs under one transaction, your counter will increase by 2.<br/>",
